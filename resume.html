<P><h3>Visual Health Assistant with Text-to-Speech:</h3>
I developed a Visual Health Assistant that integrates text-to-speech functionality to assist users in accessing health-related information more easily. The system allows users to interact with a visual interface where medical queries or health tips are converted into audible speech, enhancing accessibility, especially for visually impaired users. This project showcases my ability to combine front-end development with accessibility-focused technologies to create user-friendly solutions in the health domain.
<h3>Interactive Tax Residency Quiz:</h3>
After an in-depth study of Indian income tax laws concerning residency status, I created an interactive quiz using HTML. The quiz is designed to test and reinforce users' understanding of key concepts like the number of days rule, residential status classifications, and implications on global income. This project demonstrates both my technical skills in building web-based educational tools and my ability to apply complex legal knowledge in a simplified, engaging format.
<h4 class="hover-link"><a href="./quiz2.html">take the quiz yourself</a></h4>
<h3>Music Library Website (Capstone Project):</h3>
<p>
    Spearheaded the design and development of a fully responsive Music Library website using HTML5 and CSS3, creating a seamless user interface that adapts across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Implemented intuitive navigation with clear links to my Resume, About Me page, and an interactive Tax Residency Quiz, demonstrating strong frontâ€‘end proficiency and attention to user experience. Applied best practices in semantic markup, CSS flexbox/grid layouts, and accessibility to ensure quick load times and inclusive design. This project serves as the centerpiece of my portfolio, showcasing my ability to build cohesive, visually engaging web applications from the ground up.

<h2>Experince</h2>
<ol>
    <li>I completed a 45-day internship at HDFC Bank Ltd., where I was introduced to the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. Alongside technical skills, I gained knowledge of key tax laws and their application within the banking sector. This experience provided me with valuable insights into the operational structure of a major financial institution and enhanced my understanding of how technology supports financial services and compliance. </li>
    <li>As an active member and event coordinator of my university club, I have successfully organized multiple events, each with 50 to 100+ participants. My responsibilities included planning, budgeting, coordinating with teams, managing logistics, and ensuring timely execution. This role significantly strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities, while also helping me develop strong communication and time management skills in a real-world setting</li>
