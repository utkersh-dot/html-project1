<h3 class="h">About Me</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" >
   Hi, I’m Utkersh Sharma, an aspiring web developer with a deep love for solving problems through code and building meaningful digital experiences. I’m currently in my second year at VIT Vellore, one of India’s top engineering institutions. With every passing semester, I find myself growing more passionate about web technologies, user experience, and the endless possibilities that the internet offers for creation and communication.

At my core, I’m someone who thrives on challenges. I don’t believe in giving up easily, and I always look for the learning opportunity in every obstacle. Whether it’s fixing a bug at 2 a.m. or learning a new framework over the weekend, I enjoy testing my limits and pushing forward. I believe that a developer’s greatest strength lies not just in their skills but in their curiosity and persistence — two traits I’m proud to have cultivated.
</p>
<h3 class="h">My Passion For Web Developement</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" >

    My journey into web development began with simple curiosity — how do websites work? What makes them look beautiful and function so seamlessly? That curiosity quickly turned into fascination, and before I knew it, I was spending hours building basic layouts, experimenting with CSS, and writing my first lines of JavaScript.

As time passed, I began diving deeper into modern web technologies. I started exploring front-end frameworks like React, learned how to make responsive, mobile-friendly designs, and began understanding how back-end systems communicate with databases and APIs. The more I learned, the more I wanted to create — from personal projects to mock apps and interactive UI elements.

What draws me to web development is the balance between logic and creativity. On one hand, it’s all about algorithms, performance, and structure. On the other, it’s about colors, layouts, and the overall feel of the website. Merging these two worlds gives me immense satisfaction, and that’s why I see myself pursuing web development for years to come.
</p>
<h3 class="h">College Life At Vit(Vellore)</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" >
    Studying at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) has been nothing short of transformative. The environment here is dynamic, competitive, and filled with opportunities. From working on assignments and lab work to participating in coding contests and hackathons, I’ve been able to challenge myself both academically and creatively.

One of the best things about VIT is its diverse student community. Interacting with peers from different backgrounds has expanded my worldview, improved my communication skills, and made me more open-minded. Being involved in group projects and tech clubs has taught me teamwork, leadership, and the ability to take initiative — all qualities I know will be essential in my future career.

Apart from academics, I also use my time at VIT to attend tech seminars, webinars, and industry talks. These sessions have introduced me to real-world applications of my skills and given me insights into what it takes to thrive in the tech industry.
</p>
<h3 class="h">My Hobbies and Interests</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" >

    When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me with my earphones on, immersed in music. Music is my go-to source of relaxation and focus — it helps me disconnect from stress and reconnect with creativity. I enjoy a wide range of genres depending on my mood, from calm instrumental scores to high-energy electronic tracks. Music, for me, is a companion during both deep work sessions and peaceful evening walks.

Another passion of mine is watching critically acclaimed theatre and dramatic performances. I have a deep appreciation for the way theatre explores human emotion, storytelling, and social themes. Watching a well-crafted stage performance — whether it’s a Shakespearean classic or a modern experimental piece — always leaves me inspired. I believe theatre teaches us about empathy, timing, and the power of communication, which are valuable lessons even for someone in tech.

These interests keep me grounded, creative, and well-rounded. They allow me to take breaks from the screen and experience the world in different, artistic ways.
